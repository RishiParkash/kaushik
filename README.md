in this project i developed a dummy database file named event.js
in this dummy database i developed a list of the events in which information regarding the events are also added.
in developed the CRUD API for the events and the Session
this project can be run on localhost:8000
the API end points are:
(1)"localhost:8000/events" for getting list of all events 
(2)"localhost:8000/addEvent" for adding a new event
(3)"localhost:8000/updateEvent/:id" for updating a event
(4)"localhost:8000/deleteEvent/:id" for deleting a event
(5)"localhost:8000/deleteSession/:id" for deleting a session
